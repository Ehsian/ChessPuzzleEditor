# My Personal Project - Chess Board Editor

## Project Description

This application is a puzzle creator & custom board editor for the classic game of chess on an
8x8 board. This application will feature two major functions; making a custom position
on an 8x8 chess board (through drag and dropping chess pieces), and adding intended custom moves
on that custom chess board to create a "solution" to the puzzle/board that you created.

This project is of interest to me because I've always enjoyed playing chess,
and I've always been intrigued by how chess engines worked. I have an additional
interest in chess applications, since I have grown up alongside a major 
chess movement in software. Apps such as *Chess Titans* on Windows XP and the original
*Chess Free* app for IOS and Android will always be remembered as 
parts of my childhood.

### Sidenotes/Additional Ideas
Boards/positions may potentially be a 2D array of Strings or custom Objects.
